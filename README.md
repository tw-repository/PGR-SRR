## Environment

Please refer to the "environment.txt".

## Dataset
[PISC](https://zenodo.org/record/1059155#.WznPu_F97CI) was released by [[Li et al. ICCV 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00634)]. It involves a two-level relationship, i.e., coarse-level relationships with 3 categories and fine-level relationships with 6 categories.

[PIPA-relation](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/human-activity-recognition/social-relation-recognition/) was released by [[Sun et al. CVPR 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06456)]. It covers 5 social domains, which can be further divided into 16 social relationships. On this dataset, we focus on the 16 social relationships.
